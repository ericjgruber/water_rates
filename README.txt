### ABOUT THIS PROJECT ###

* More of an experiment in how to use a graphical JavaScript library, the purpose of this is to use open information to graphicly display data points. Since I am a resident of this city and a former employee of the local municipal government, I thought I'd use some of the information I knew was available to have some fun with this project.
* Version 0.1


### CONTACT INFORMATION ###
